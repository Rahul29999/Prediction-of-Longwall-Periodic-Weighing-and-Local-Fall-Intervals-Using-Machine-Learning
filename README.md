## üîß **Methodology**

### **1. Data Collection**
Data is sourced from sensors, geological surveys, and historical logs, focusing on key parameters:
- **Periodic Weighting Interval (Lp)**: Distance between consecutive roof weighings.
- **Time Interval (Tp)**: Time between weighings.
- **Shield Leg Pressure**: Measurements of roof support stress.

### **2. Data Preprocessing**
- **Missing Value Imputation**: Handled using mean and regression techniques.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created interaction terms between variables like overburden thickness and mining depth.
- **Normalization**: Ensured consistency across numerical features.

### **3. Model Development**
Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models:
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**

### **4. Model Evaluation**
Used metrics like:
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** for classification tasks.

### **5. Real-Time Deployment**
- Integrated with control systems for continuous monitoring of geo-mining conditions.
- Deployed an alert system to warn against impending roof falls or excessive loads.
